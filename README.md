## Task Objective
This company is the largest online loan marketplace, facilitating personal loans, business loans, and financing of medical procedures. Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

Like most other lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source of financial loss (called credit loss). The credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words, borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.



## Conclusions
- NV and AK states have high percentage of defaulters . Company needs to take extra caution while providing loan.
- Majority of the people have took the 36 months tenure period
- Regarding Mortgage customers company is loaning higher amount for purpose not associated to House , company needs to take extra caution as they do already need to pay Mortgage amount along with other credit accounts 
- Majority of the people who applied for the loan are living on rent or mortgage
- People having less income are more likely to default.
- As the loan amount is high for Small Business and Housing , lot of defaulters are under it hence company need to produce new strategy to tackle these customers by taking more stake regarding their business or house. 
- As the grades gets lower, charge off rate increases proportionately.
- Higher the dti,more likely the charge off
- As number of bankruptcies increases the charge off rate also increases
- We see a greater number of Not Verified defaulters requested loan for Medical purpose as it can't be denied , company should think to lower the interest rate for these loans so small instalments can easily be paid .
- The interest rate in charged off were higher than that of fully paid which may infer that higher interest rate could result in higher charge offs
- Company should not be providing Higher Loan amount for Not Verified customers except for Medical purpose.
- Company needs to ramp up Verification status as  43% of customers are not verified and it's a risk in lending loans without performing proper background verifications
